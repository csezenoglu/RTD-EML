In the literature, there are two main types of electromagnetic launcher. The main difference of these types that supply current is direct connected to armature (railgun) or induced in the armature (coilgun). For the railguns the armature and stator current, relative position and velocity of each other are independent. For the coilguns hte induced armature current is a fuction of the stator current and its position and velocity :cite:`engel:2017`. Other kinds of launchers and classifications can be found in the literature :cite:`weldon:1989` :cite:`engel:2017`. In this work, induction type electromagnetics launchers are investigated.
