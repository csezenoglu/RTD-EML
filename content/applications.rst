Applications
============

Two examples of conceptual design of induction launchers were given. The first example was a proposal for a coaxial induction accelerator having the task of accelerating a 1 kg projectile to a velocity of 10 km/s. A second example (Nimitz-class electromagnetic aircraft launcher) was in designed to achieve a continuous 5 g acceleration of an 8182 kg load :cite:`driga:1986`.
