A proposal for a coaxial induction accelerator having the task of accelerating a 1 kg projectile to a velocity of 10 km/s :cite:`driga:1986`.

Aircraft launcher
=================

A half-scale aircraft launcher (Nimitz-class electromagnetic aircraft launcher) was designed to achieve a continuous 5 g acceleration of an 8182 kg load. In addition, it acts as an electromagnetic brake that stops the shuttle :cite:`driga:1986`.

#  However, one of the earliest applications of the short stator variant of an induction accelerator was the Westinghouse aircraft launcher, under the name "Electropult" (1946) [7]-> A Wound Rotor Motor" 1,400 ft. long, Westinghouse, Engineer, 1946, (pp. 760-764).
