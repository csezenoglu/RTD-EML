Different coilgun names:

- Coaxial Launcher (i.e. tubular induction accelerator; circular symmetry implied by the term coaxial)
- Linear Induction Launcher (LIL): The barrel of the LIL consists of a linear array of coils carrying polyphase currents.
- Double Sided Induction Accelerator (e.g. Aircraft launcher)
	
The current interest in electromagnetic acceleration of masses has resulted in something of a competition between the railguns and coaxial accelerators. If proliferation is any measure of success, railguns presently appear to be leading the competition. Actually, there are several fundamental reasons why the railguns are enjoying their present surge of popularity which in no way reflects inherent superiority over the induction launchers for all applications [Driga et al., 1986].

Railguns are the simplest of the electromagnetic launchers and it is natural that they should be developed first. They undoubtedly benefit from the fact that virtually anyone with access to a laboratory or shop can quickly fabricate a small railgun which will accelerate a projectile. This advantage of simplicity is compounded by the scaling relationships for the two concepts. Whereas the inductance gradient of the railgun is essentially independent of scale, the comparable gradient for induction launchers is quite sensitive to it, improving dramatically in larger accelerators. Thus, it is quite difficult to build a small-scale coaxial launcher with impressive performance [Driga et al., 1986].

Moreover, the railgun has had the benefit of the existence of the pulsed homopolar generator in conjunction with an inductor and an opening switch, an inherently compatible power supply, that had been developed for other programs. The induction launchers enjoyed no such serendipitous benefit and have suffered as a result. In fact, much of the effort expended on the development of coaxial accelerators to date, when viewed in this light, appears to have been directed toward forcing the accelerator to conform to existing power supplied [Driga et al., 1986].

Potential benefits of coilgun:

- Increased efficiency
- Greater freedom of projectile design
- Elimination of switching and synchronization requirements

Among so many variants, few have merit as simple and efficient accelerators. We will limit ourselves to the double sided induction accelerator, and the tubular accelerator [Driga et al., 1986].

Only the tubular induction accelerator has the circular symmetry implied by the term coaxial [Driga et al., 1986].
