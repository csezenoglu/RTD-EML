Driga et al. describes efforts to solve forcing the accelerator to conform to existing power supplies by pursuing the development of a coaxial launcher with an integrated pulsed power supply designed specifically to meet the requirements of the launcher :cite:`driga:1986`.

Another approach, used by Driga et al :cite:`driga:1986` is to design the coilgun as a linear induction motor, based on the model for conventional electrical machines :cite:`zabar:1989`.

Rising Frequency Generator
==========================

# A CEM concept called the "rising frequency generator" (RFG) [6] is proposed to meet the power supply requirements of ,the coaxial accelerator. This device can utilize the electrical  generating configuration of an alternator, low impedance alternator, or compulsator -- single or multiphase. It consists of a rotor and a stator having a lnoment of inertia many times higher than the rotor (a naturally occurring situation which can be tailored by design) both of which are initially rotating in the same direction, the stator rotational speed being somewhat higher. The e:ectrical frequency of the output, of course, is a function of the differential speed, :math:`\omega_s-\omega_r`, as is the generated voltage. As power is generated, equal and opposite torques will be applied to the rotor and stator, and the rotor will change speed faster (slow down) due toits lower inertia. As the rotor slows, the differential between rotor and stator speed increases, increasing frequency and output voltage and achieving the desired effect :cite:`driga:1986`. 

Homopolar Generator
===================

# A variant of this RFG concept involves using a stationary stator with a rotating magnetic field produced by a multiphase AC excitation current.

# By matching the generator voltage, frequency, rotor and stator inertias, and initial velocities to the requirements of the coaxial accelerator, or integrated power supply/accelerator system can be designed. An ixportant part of this integration is done by mounting the pulse generator excitation source (i.e., homopolar generator) on the same shaft as the pulse generator thus forminga "cascade" of electrical machines essential to obtaining the proper electromechanical energy conversion :cite:`driga:1986`.
