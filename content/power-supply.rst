Driga et al. describes efforts to solve forcing the accelerator to conform to existing power supplies by pursuing the development of a coaxial launcher with an integrated pulsed power supply designed specifically to meet the requirements of the launcher :cite:`driga:1986`.

Another approach, used by Driga et al :cite:`driga:1986` is to design the coil -gun as a linear induction motor, based on the model for conventional electrical machines :cite:`zabar:1989`.
