Coilgun vs Railgun
******************

.. Railgun ile coilgun arasındaki yarış ve popülerite

# The current interest in electromagnetic acceleration of masses has resulted in something of a competition between the railguns and coaxial accelerators. If proliferation is any measure of success, railguns presently appear to be leading the competition. Actually, there are several fundamental reasons why the railguns are enjoying their present surge of popularity which in no way reflects inherent superiority over the induction launchers for all applications :cite:`driga:1986`.

.. Railgun basit olduğu için ilk olarak o geliştirilmiştir ve kolayca üretilebilir
.. Railgun ın inductance gradient i boyuttan bağımsızdır ancak coilgun da değişir bu yüzden küçük boyutlarda iyi performanslı coilgun üretmek zordur.

# Railguns are the simplest of the electromagnetic launchers and it is natural that they should be developed first. They undoubtedly benefit from the fact that virtually anyone with access to a laboratory or shop can quickly fabricate a small railgun which will accelerate a projectile. This advantage of simplicity is compounded by the scaling relationships for the two concepts. Whereas the inductance gradient of the railgun is essentially independent of scale, the comparable gradient for induction launchers is quite sensitive to it, improving dramatically in larger accelerators. Thus, it is quite difficult to build a small-scale coaxial launcher with impressive performance :cite:`driga:1986`.

.. Railgun farklı uygulamalar için geliştirilmiş darbe homopolar güç kaynağını bir anahtar yardımıyla kullanabilir. 
.. İndüksiyon fırlatıcılar ise bu bakış açısı ile varolan güç kaynaklarını kullanabilmek için üzerinde çalışılmaktadır.

# Moreover, the railgun has had the benefit of the existence of the pulsed homopolar generator in conjunction with an inductor and an opening switch, an inherently compatible power supply, that had been developed for other programs. The induction launchers enjoyed no such serendipitous benefit and have suffered as a result. In fact, much of the effort expended on the development of coaxial accelerators to date, when viewed in this light, appears to have been directed toward forcing the accelerator to conform to existing power supplied :cite:`driga:1986`.

# Potential benefits include increased efficiency, greater freedom of projectile design, and elimination of switching and synchronization requirements :cite:`driga:1986`.

# Railguns have demonstrated very high velocities, and they are simple in concept and in practice. A respectable 30 percent electrical-to-kinetic energy efficiency has been achieved. Several concepts for coaxial launchershave also received some attention. Their efficiencies are potentially much greater than railgun efficiencies, but they tendto involve greater system complexity. The outcome of the trade-offs between simplicity and efficiency depends strongly on the detailed design constraints of a specific application [1983 Fast Electromagnetic Launchers].
